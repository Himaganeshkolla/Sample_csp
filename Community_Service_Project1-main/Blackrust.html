Symptoms
There are three rust diseases that occur on wheat: stem rust, leaf rust and stripe rust. These diseases are each caused by a particular species of the “rust” fungus, Puccinia. Rust fungi all produce similar disease symptoms on the host plants and have similar requirements for infection. The diseases get their name from their appearance on the plant (Figure 1). Infection can occur on any above-ground plant part, leading to the production of pustules that contain thousands of dry yellow-orange to reddish-brown or black spores. These pustules give the appearance of “rust” on the plant.

Stem rust occurs primarily on stems but can also be found on leaves, sheaths, glumes, awns, and even seed. Symptoms begin as oval to elongate lesions that are generally reddish-brown in color. In the late stages of the disease, erumpent pustules produce numerous black sooty spores. Severe infestations with many stem lesions may weaken plant stems and result in lodging.

Causal Organis

Stem rust (also known as black stem rust) is caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. It is primarily a disease on wheat, though it can also cause minor infections on certain cultivars of barley and rye. Leaf rust is caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici (now known as Puccinia triticina). Like the stem rust fungus, this pathogen is primarily a problem on wheat, but it may be weakly pathogenic on some cultivars of barley, triticale, and some species of goatgrass and wheatgrass. The third rust disease, stripe rust, is caused by Puccinia striiformis. This pathogen also affects barley, rye, triticale, and over 18 species of grasses. Economic losses from stripe rust are generally restricted to wheat and barley crops.

Disease Development
Water on the leaf surface from intermittent rains or heavy dews and temperatures conducive for germination and growth of the pathogen are required for disease development. Stem rust is a warm-temperature disease that develops optimally between 65 and 85°F; however, the disease can occur at temperatures between 59 and 104°F. Leaf rust develops optimally at temperatures between 59 and 71°F, and the disease will progress until temperatures are above 80°F. Stripe rust is a lower-temperature disease that is generally found at higher elevations and in cooler climates. The optimal temperature for the development of this disease is 50 to 59°F, with disease progression ceasing at temperatures above 70°F.

When conditions are optimal for disease development, infection is completed in 6–8 hours and uredospores capable of causing secondary spread of the disease are produced in 7–10 days. Uredospores are relatively limited in the length of time they remain viable compared to other spore stages produced by rust fungi. Yet they are extremely efficient in spreading disease because they are produced in large quantities and are easily spread by wind. In locations with mild winters, uredospores have been found to survive year-round. Therefore, alternate hosts and some spore stages are required to complete the pathogen’s life cycle but are not needed for the initiation of new infections each year.

Prevention
One of the only early prevention methods for avoiding rust diseases or minimizing their impact is to plant a variety with known resistance. Variety resistance is the most economical method of control. In some cases, avoiding rust is not possible because of constant changes in strains (races) of the pathogens. For example, varieties formerly rated as “resistant” have, in recent years, begun to show signs of susceptibility at various locations. In many situations, the varieties remained resistant for only three to four years before showing signs of susceptibility. Large differences in susceptibility exist among wheat varieties. Contact your local county Extension office (http://aces.nmsu.edu/county/) for a list of adapted and potentially resistant wheat varieties for your area.
Managing Rust
In some cases, rust fungi may infect wheat after planting in fall; pustules and yellow (chlorotic) leaves can become evident early in the growing cycle of the plant. Usually, damage is minimal during tillering due to the onset of colder temperatures that are likely to eliminate the rust or reduce reproduction and spread of rusts over winter, especially in more northern parts of the state. However, if winter temperatures are mild, rust infection may persist into spring, and later growth stages could be affected. Field scouting is very important for monitoring of diseases and for diagnosis of problems before they get out of hand.
